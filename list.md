# OncoPredictAI Project Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Designed a standardized folder structure based on big tech ML project best practices
   - Created a detailed folder structure in `folder_structure.md`
   - Structure follows industry standards with clear separation of concerns

2. ✅ Created initial directory structure
   - Set up main directories for data, models, src, config, etc.
   - Established proper folder hierarchy for different types of models and data

3. ✅ Relocated existing implementation files
   - Moved `kmeans.py` from ml_library to models/clustering/
   - Moved `pca.py` from ml_library to models/dimensionality_reduction/
   - Created appropriate `__init__.py` files for Python package structure

4. ✅ Created important configuration files
   - Set up `config/default.yaml` with model parameters, data paths, etc.
   - Configured logging, visualization settings, and hyperparameters

5. ✅ Set up key pipeline components
   - Created core files for data loading/processing in src/data/
   - Implemented visualization utilities in src/visualization/
   - Added model training and prediction functionality in src/models/
   - Created evaluation metrics and logging infrastructure in src/utils/

6. ✅ Established testing infrastructure
   - Set up unit tests for data processing in tests/test_data.py
   - Created model testing functionality in tests/test_models.py

7. ✅ Organized documentation and project metadata
   - README.md contains project overview and goals
   - ML_MODELS.md details model implementations
   - PROJECT_PLAN.md outlines the implementation phases

8. ✅ Created exploratory data analysis notebook
   - Implemented `01_cancer_data_exploration.ipynb` in notebooks/exploration/
   - Set up data loading, visualization, statistics, and initial modeling
   - Added PCA and clustering analysis for the cancer dataset

9. ✅ Relocated dataset download scripts
   - Moved download scripts to scripts/ directory
   - Updated references to maintain functionality

## In Progress / Partially Completed

1. ⏳ Completing the implementation of data preprocessing functions
   - Basic structure created, but some functions need full implementation
   - Have implemented key preprocessing steps for numerical and categorical features
   - Need to implement additional data cleaning functions

2. ⏳ Feature engineering pipeline
   - Basic structure created in src/features/build_features.py
   - Need to implement specific feature transformations
   - Started implementing risk factor interaction features

3. ⏳ Model training scripts
   - Framework established for model training workflows
   - K-means and PCA implementations complete
   - Started implementation of RandomForest model
   - Need to implement remaining model types (XGBoost, Time Series, etc.)

4. ⏳ Implementation of model evaluation utilities
   - Basic evaluation metrics created in src/utils/evaluation.py
   - Need to implement more comprehensive evaluation functions
   - Started implementing visualizations for model results

## Pending Tasks

1. ✅ Create environment and project setup files
   - Created environment.yml with conda dependencies
   - Created requirements.txt with pip dependencies 
   - Added setup.py for pip installation
   - Created .gitignore for version control
   - Set up proper dependencies for development and production

2. 📋 Complete main application code
   - Finish implementing the src/main.py script
   - Ensure all pipeline components work together

3. 📋 Create standard experiment configs
   - Add examples in config/experiment_configs/
   - Create model-specific hyperparameter configurations

4. 📋 Set up proper documentation
   - Add docstrings to all functions
   - Create comprehensive documentation in docs/

5. 📋 Create application components
   - Implement API endpoints for model serving
   - Create simple frontend for demonstration

6. 📋 Create automated workflows
   - Scripts for common tasks
   - Pipeline orchestration

## Next Steps

1. 🔜 Complete implementation of unfinished functions in data processing
2. 🔜 Update analyze_cancer_data.py to use the new project structure 
3. 🔜 Create additional exploratory and modeling notebooks
4. 🔜 Implement remaining model types mentioned in ML_MODELS.md
5. 🔜 Create comprehensive testing for all components
6. 🔜 Complete additional utility scripts and tools
