# OncoPredictAI Project Plan

## Project Overview

OncoPredictAI is a machine learning project focused on analyzing global cancer data to predict patient outcomes and optimize treatment strategies. This project plan focuses on the implementation strategy using the Global Cancer Patients dataset.

## Phase 1: Data Analysis and Exploration

### 1.1. Data Loading and Cleaning
- Load the global_cancer_patients_2015_2024.csv dataset
- Check for missing values and outliers
- Apply appropriate preprocessing (encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features)

### 1.2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Generate descriptive statistics for all features
- Visualize distributions of key variables:
  - Age distribution
  - Risk factors (Genetic_Risk, Air_Pollution, Alcohol_Use, Smoking, Obesity_Level)
  - Cancer types and stages
  - Treatment costs and survival years
- Analyze correlations between risk factors and outcomes

### 1.3. Feature Analysis with PCA
- Apply the existing PCA implementation to identify key factors
- Visualize the principal components and their explained variance
- Interpret the relationships between variables in reduced dimensions

## Phase 2: Patient Segmentation with K-means

### 2.1. Cluster Analysis
- Apply the existing K-means implementation to segment patients
- Determine optimal number of clusters using silhouette score
- Characterize each cluster based on:
  - Predominant cancer types and stages
  - Common risk profiles
  - Treatment outcomes and costs

### 2.2. Segmentation Visualization
- Create visualizations of the clusters in 2D/3D space
- Develop interpretable dashboards showing cluster characteristics
- Generate insights on patient subgroups and their unique needs

## Phase 3: Predictive Model Development

### 3.1. Target Variable Selection
- Define prediction targets:
  - Primary: Target_Severity_Score
  - Secondary: Survival_Years

### 3.2. Model Implementation
- Implement Random Forest or XGBoost model for severity prediction
- Apply appropriate cross-validation strategies
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

### 3.3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared
- Compare model performance and select the best approach

## Phase 4: Risk Factor Analysis

### 4.1. Feature Importance
- Identify the most significant risk factors affecting outcomes
- Analyze how different combinations of risk factors impact severity
- Develop risk profiles for different cancer types

### 4.2. Treatment Cost Optimization
- Develop models to predict treatment costs based on patient characteristics
- Identify opportunities for resource optimization
- Create recommendations for efficient resource allocation

## Phase 5: Integration and Deployment

### 5.1. Pipeline Development
- Create an end-to-end pipeline from data ingestion to prediction
- Establish automated preprocessing and model application
- Design a modular architecture for easy updates and maintenance

### 5.2. Visualization Dashboard
- Develop interactive dashboards for exploring prediction results
- Create tools for healthcare professionals to use the models
- Implement interpretable outputs for clinical decision support

## Future Extensions

### X-ray Integration
- Once the cancer data project is successful, begin integrating the X-ray dataset
- Implement CNN or transfer learning models for pneumonia detection
- Create a comprehensive cancer care platform with both tabular and imaging capabilities

### Additional Datasets
- Explore integrating additional cancer-related datasets
- Investigate applications to other medical conditions
- Extend to regional or country-specific analysis
