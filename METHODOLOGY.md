# Methodology and Workflow

## Data Flow Architecture
```
[Data Sources] → [Data Acquisition] → [Data Preprocessing] → [Feature Engineering] 
→ [Model Training] → [Evaluation] → [Visualization] → [Clinical Application]
```

## Workflow Phases
1. **Data Acquisition:** Download and verify datasets using scripts and Kaggle API.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean, impute, encode, and scale data (see `src/data/preprocessing.py`).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis (see notebooks).
4. **Feature Engineering:** Feature selection, creation, scaling, and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
5. **Model Development:** Implement clustering (K-means), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
6. **Training & Evaluation:** Train models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate using appropriate metrics.
7. **Visualization:** Generate interpretable plots and dashboards for insights.
8. **Integration:** Orchestrate the pipeline via `src/main.py` and expose results via API/front-end.
