# Machine Learning Models

## Implemented Models
- **K-means Clustering:** For patient segmentation and resource analysis. Custom K-means++ initialization and silhouette score analysis.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** For dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Includes explained variance visualization.

## Planned Models
- **Random Forest:** For triage optimization and severity prediction. Emphasis on interpretability and feature importance.
- **XGBoost:** For length of stay and outcome prediction. Handles class imbalance and supports early stopping.
- **LightGBM:** For resource utilization optimization. Optimized for CPU and limited hardware.
- **Time Series (ARIMA, Prophet):** For patient volume forecasting and seasonal trend analysis.
- **Ensemble Methods:** For disease outbreak detection using weighted voting.
- **Federated Learning:** For privacy-preserving, multi-facility modeling.

## Model Selection Rationale
- Models are chosen for interpretability, efficiency, and suitability for resource-constrained healthcare environments.
- See `ML_MODELS.md` for detailed descriptions and hyperparameter examples.
