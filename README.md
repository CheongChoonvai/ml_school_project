## Problem Statement
Cancer care globally faces significant challenges that can be addressed through advanced analytics and machine learning:

1. **Complex Risk Factor Interactions**: Multiple risk factors (genetic, environmental, lifestyle) interact in complex ways that are difficult to analyze with traditional methods.

2. **Treatment Selection Optimization**: Identifying the most effective treatments for specific cancer types and patient profiles remains challenging with high costs of suboptimal choices.

3. **Resource Allocation Inefficiencies**: Limited healthcare resources are often not allocated optimally, leading to unnecessary expenses and reduced patient outcomes.

4. **Survival Prediction Accuracy**: Current methods for predicting cancer severity and patient survival can lack precision, impacting treatment planning and patient counseling.

5. **Data Heterogeneity**: Cancer data is often siloed across different healthcare systems and countries, limiting insights that could be gained from comprehensive analysis.

6. **Global Cancer Pattern Understanding**: Insufficient tools exist for analyzing global patterns in cancer incidence, progression, and treatment effectiveness across different regions.

    'learning_rate': 0.01,           # Slower learning rate for better convergence
    'n_estimators': 500,             # More estimators for robust ensemble
    'subsample': 0.8,                # Subsampling for robustness to outliers
    'colsample_bytree': 0.75,        # Feature sampling to prevent overfitting
    'min_child_weight': 3,           # Controls model complexity
