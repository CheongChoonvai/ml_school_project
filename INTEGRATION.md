# Integration and Deployment

## Integration Strategy
- **API Layer:** Standardized interfaces for model training, inference, and results.
- **Caching:** Store results for offline operation and efficiency.
- **Scheduled Retraining:** Automatic updates as new data arrives.
- **Explainability:** Visualizations and simple explanations for clinical staff.
- **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for user feedback on model performance.

## Pipeline Orchestration
- Main entry point: `src/main.py` (supports train, predict, evaluate modes)
- Configurable via YAML files in `config/`
- Modular design for easy updates and maintenance

## Deployment
- Results and models saved in `outputs/`
- Future: API endpoints and simple front-end for demonstration
